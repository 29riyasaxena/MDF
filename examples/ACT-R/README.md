# Interactions between MDF and ACT-R

This directory contains examples of ACT-R models converted to MDF. The ACT-R
models [count.lisp](count.lisp) and [addition.lisp](addition.lisp) are based on 
the [ACT-R tutorial](http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/software/).

The script [create_examples.py](create_examples.py) was used to create the MDF
.json, .yaml, and .gv.png files for each example.
