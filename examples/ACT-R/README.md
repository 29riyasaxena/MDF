# Interactions between MDF and ACT-R

This directory contains examples of ACT-R models converted to MDF. The ACT-R
models [count.lisp](count.lisp) and [addition.lisp](addition.lisp) are based on 
the [ACT-R tutorial](http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/software/).

The scripts [count.py](count.py) and [addition.py](addition.py) can be run
to create the MDF .json and .yaml files for the given example and execute it
using the MDF scheduler.
