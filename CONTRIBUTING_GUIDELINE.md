### ðŸ”–Steps to Contribute

Following are the steps to guide you:

* Step 1: Fork the repo and Go to your Git terminal and  clone it on your machine.
* Step 2: Add a upstream link to main branch in your cloned repo
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ModECI/MDF.git
    ```
* Step 3: Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
    ```
    git pull upstream main https://github.com/ModECI/MDF.git
    ```
* Step 4: Create your feature branch (This is a necessary step in order to avoid any disorder in main branch(ie:bugfix22/update-xfile))
    ```
    git checkout -b <feature-name>
    ```
* Step 5: Commit all the changes (Write commit message as "Small Message")
    ```
    git commit -m "Write a meaningfull but small commit message"
    ```
* Step 6: Push the changes for review
    ```
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
* Step 7: Create a PR on Github. 
     - Don't just hit the create a pull request button, you should write a PR message to clarify why and what are you contributing.
     - Put the hashtag of issue in a commit message for the pull request, and it will show up in the issue itself which will make easy for mentors to review your PR based on issue.
